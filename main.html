	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. Specifically, it refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input data grows. Analyzing this allows developers to predict how long their programs will run and helps in choosing the most efficient algorithm to solve a particular problem. This analysis is crucial when dealing with large datasets or time-sensitive applications where performance is a key concern.</p>
